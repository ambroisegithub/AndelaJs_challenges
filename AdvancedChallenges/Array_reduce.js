// To remove duplicates using the reduce() method, you need to 
// declare an array as the accumulator value. In each iteration,
// check if the item is already included in the accumulator using the includes() method. 
// Here, you can see that the reduce() method returns an array (without any duplicates)
//  instead of a single value.
